Abstract
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is designed to enhance text generation by leveraging external knowledge retrieval. Combining document retrieval and language generation, this system integrates a retrieval mechanism with a generation model to produce contextually relevant and coherent responses.

Key Features:
Data Source Integration: Utilizes a document database for sourcing external knowledge.
Retrieval Mechanism: Employs advanced embedding techniques to search and retrieve relevant documents based on user queries.
Generation Model: Uses a state-of-the-art language model (GPT-2) to generate text based on retrieved documents and user input.
Interactive Layer: Built using Flask, providing a web-based interface for user interaction and real-time response generation.
Workflow:
Data Loading: Preprocesses and stores text data in a document database.
Embedding Generation: Creates vector representations of documents and user queries.
Query Handling: Retrieves relevant documents using similarity search.
Response Generation: Produces responses by integrating retrieved information with the GPT-2 model.
This project demonstrates a practical application of combining retrieval and generation techniques to enhance natural language understanding and generation. Future enhancements will focus on model fine-tuning, performance optimization, and additional feature integration.
