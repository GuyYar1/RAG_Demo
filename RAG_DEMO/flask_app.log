2024-09-09 02:02:37,894 - INFO - Generated response: this film is extraordinarily horrendous and i'm not going to waste any more words on it. 
 an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices. 
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie. 
a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better. 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i fouled my expectations and i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot. 
the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing. 
as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part was not utilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ). 
there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
the movie was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellie is the reason for this. 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them. 
i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie. 
 i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies. 
luckily, my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta! 
i knew i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't knowt was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality, but i couldn't help myself... 
i got it. 
well, after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 
this movie really sucks. 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy!! 
for example, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days? 
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail. 
the songs are bad, the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ), and the direction is the worst of all. 
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up. 
i didn't even finish the movie... 
i couldn't take it anymore. 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ), i guess you'd like this movie. 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff. 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick agai, and the other two are the main characters. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
 ( i was going to give it a zero, but i personally like jackie shroff, so i loosened up a little. 
he looked fresh, wore good clothes ( as always ), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was the only saving grace of the movie ) 
 mr. bean, a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting. 
the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la, but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride. 
heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick. 
either way look out america bean is coming. 
well, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot. 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy. 
it achieves that goal rather admirably, but because it is that, the plot is just screaming for help. 
the whole premise that the movie is based  on is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a goodon is to say the least flawed. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went. 
don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece. 
but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie, even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid. 
the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims, or so it seems. 
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things, first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner. 
well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the slapstick style. 
but the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known of those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the rest of the world. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie. 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst. 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that, if you are a normal person, you leave feeling sick. 
when i saw this movie i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick it's not trying to be funny, it's trying to be melodramatic--but it's just annoying, stupid and sappy. 
at best. 
this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived. 
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that you are overly fond of boob, fart, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane. 
yes, literally insane. 
stark, raving mad. 
it is boring, stupid, melodramatic and in the end ugly. 
i reccemond it strongly. 
to ed wood.

2024-09-09 02:04:19,774 - INFO - Generated response: susan granger's review of " american outlaws " ( warner bros. ) 
thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero. 
now, more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later, jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend. 
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scott younger ( scott caan, will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ), after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war, return to liberty, missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown. 
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron, thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ), is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value, aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who, back then, were just thugs who provided security. 
the story ends with a gang of outlaws riding a train through the woods of the city of New York, where they are met by a group of outlaws who are trying to steal their land. 
the story ends with a gang 
but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims, jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines, sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept. 
plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal, lee mimms ( ali larter ). 
working from a politically-correct, clich? -drenched, sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers, director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can. 
the choppy editing hurts but russell boyd's cinematography, luke reichle's designer duds and trevor rabin's music lend authenticity. 
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " american outlaws " is a galloping, formulaic 3. 
it's the wild west re-visited as a date movie. 
 long time buddies and neil diamond tribute band members wayne ( steve zahn, " happy, texas " ) and j. d. ( jack black, " james " ) are the only ones who can't get over the fact that they're the only ones who can't get over the fact that they're the only ones who can't get over the fact that they're the only ones who can't high fidelity " ) watch in horror as third mate darren silverman ( jason biggs, " american pie " ) disappears under the thumb of his new fiance judith, ( amanda peet, " the whole nine yards " ) a controlling psychiatrist. 
they're doubly troubled when the return of darren's 'one and only love' sandy perkins ( amanda detmer, " final destination " ) returns to their home town but doesn't cause a ripple in darren's devotion to judith. 
there's only one thing wayne and j. d. can think of doing - they kidnap judith and fake her death in " saving silverman. " 
written by hank nelken and greg depaul after seeing a friend engaged to the wrong woman, " saving silverman " is directed by 'hit comedy director' dennis dugan of such films as " big daddy, " " brain donors " and " problem child. " 
it's a dismal, third-rate farrelly brothers rip off that attempts to milk humor from such inspired bits of whimsy as having darren's love interest come from a family of circus freaks and be about to become a nun. 
goddess of the underworld, darren's love interest, is a very good actress and a very good actress. 
she's a very good actress and a very good actress. 
she's a very good actress and a very goodross out gags include a visualization of darren getting butt cheek implants. 
 " saving silverman " is almost saved by stars zahn and black. 
these two are so comically talented they can take bad material and still deliver the goods. 
they're in " animal house " mode while the rest of the film trawls along and comes up empty. 
jason biggs can attribute his entire career to the luck of having been cast in the smash hit " american pie. " 
peet shows some physical moves but no flair for comedy here while detmer slaps a brave, sweet smile onto her face and soldiers through. 
r. lee ermey ( " full metal jacket " ) is one note in an embarrassing performance as a psychopathic ex-football coach. 
neil diamond appears at the film's climax as himself and miraculously enlivens the proceedings by belting out some of his old standards. 
 disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with, well, the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center. 
great wit, great art, and  a great cast of characters. 
the film is a great example of how to make a film that is not only funny but also a great one. 
the film is a great example of how to make a film that is not onlya great villain ( james woods as hades, lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero, his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ), and a largely unremarkable soundtrack. 
 ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy. 
some lack lyrical snap. 
others need more memorable melodies. 
boring ballads we expect, but boring production numbers, too? ) 
so, hercules is a bit of a long sit, but you won't stay bored. 
the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ), a steady stream of anachronisms ( " somebody call ix-i-i " ) and pop references ( " let's get ready to rumble! " ) a la aladdin, and several long-overdue jabs at the mouse's marketing and merchandising depart- ments. 
while not as rock-solid as hunchback, it's a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas. 
directed by ron clements and john musker, with voice credits including the aforementioned " The Last of Us ", " The Last of Us 2 ", " The Last of Us 3 ", " The Last of Us 4 ", " The Last of Us 5 ", " The Last of Us 6 ", " tate donovan, susan egan, bob goldthwait, matt frewer, samantha eggar, paul shaffer, and, as lighting bolt zeus, rip torn, who's having a very good summer, also appearing in trial and error and men in black. 
 the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane!, the " police squad! " 
television series, top secret!, three naked gun films, and two hot shots! 
movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard. 
even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof. 
leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40, who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis, general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ). 
the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint, timing, or tact. 
most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags, recreated movie sequences, and soggy star cameos. 
yeah, maybe we * do * need ray charles driving an l. a. bus bound for a speed bump, but diplo is a good guy, and he's a good guy. 
the movie is a little too long, but it's still a good movie. 
the movie is a little too long, but it's still a good movie.d mr. t, hulk hogan, and dr. joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie? 
leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair. 
there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit, even the resulting sister act spoof is silly. 
as are the bits directly lifted from home alone, pulp fiction, true lies, etc. etc. ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess, tho. 
the butt shots, breast peeks, penis pokes, flatulence gags, and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley. ) 
beyond the hilarious title sequence with " weird " al yankovich performing the theme song, spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on. 
my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start. 
stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave. 
you won't miss a thing. 
 susan granger's review of " osmosis jones " ( warner bros. ) 
if the farrelly brothers taught anatomy & physiology in school, no one would be able to tell the difference between a penis and a vagina. 
the brothers are so good at their craft that they can't even tell the difference between a penis and a vagina. 
the brothers are so good at their craft one would cut ever class. 
this hip, live action/animation story begins as a monkey snatches a hard-boiled egg from frank, a zookeeper ( bill murray ), who grabs it back, drops it, then gobbles up the contaminated morsel, explaining, " if it hits and ground and you pick it up within 10 seconds, you can eat it. " 
like " fantastic voyage " ( 1966 ), the pseudo-science animation then takes over when his body's immune system contacts traffic control as an ingested virus hits the digestive system : " be on the alert for illegal organisms! " 
eager to right " a stomach evacuation mistake " he once made, a cocky, clever, courageous white blood cell ( chris rock ) declares, " this is a crime scene! " 
and teams up with a conscientious " phi beta capsule " 12-hour cold remedy called drixenol ( david hyde pierce ) to chase down and destroy the deadly " red death " virus ( laurence fishburne ) that's determined to take frank down in 48 hours, beating ebola and e. coli to a medical record. 
watch ou " a " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "t for mucus mudslides, chaos in cerebellum hall and the detritus from booger dam ( runny nose ), along with comic turns from molly shannon and chris elliot, plus the voices of william shatner and brandy norwood. 
peter and bobby farrelly, along with writer mark hyman and animation directors piet kroon and tom sito, have turned their penchant for gross-out comedy, encompassing flatulence, festering sores and " popping a pimple without a permit, " into a funny, farrelly-funny family film. 
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " osmosis jones " is a wildly imaginative, original, explosive 7. 
and perhaps, as they're laughing, kids will learn where to find their uvula, along with nuggets about nutrition and hygiene. 
Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hel Hel Hello it it it it it this film is extraordinarily horrendous and i'm not going to waste any more words on it. 
 an affluent horse breeder's past cuddly and a young man's love for the world's most famous horse, the film is a tale of two men who are both very good at their jobs and very good at their lives. 
and a young man's love for the worldomes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices.

ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that, if you aint going to watch it, you might as well just watch it. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good. 
but it's not good enough. 
i'm not sayingre a normal person, you leave feeling sick. 
when i saw this movie i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital.

at best. 
this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived. 
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that you are overly fond of boob, fart, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane. 
yes, literally insane.

2024-09-09 02:11:25,295 - INFO - Generated response: disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with, well, the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center. 
great wit, great art, and a great villain ( james woods as hades, lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero, his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ), and a largely unremarkable soundtrack. 
 ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy. 
some lack lyrical snap. 
others need more memorable melodies. 
boring ballads we expect, but boring production numbers, too? ) 
so, hercules is a bit of a long sit, but you won't stay bored. 
the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ), a steady stream of anachronisms ( " somebody call ix-i-i " ) and pop references ( " let's get ready to rumble! " ) a la aladdin, and several long-overdue jabs at the mouse's marketing and merchandising depart- ments of the original. 
the film is a bit of a slog, but it's a good one. 
the film is a bit of a slog, but it's a good one.         ents. 
while not as rock-solid as hunchback, it's a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas. 
directed by ron clements and john musker, with voice credits including tate donovan, susan egan, bob goldthwait, matt frewer, samantha eggar, paul shaffer, and, as lighting bolt zeus, rip torn, who's having a very good summer, also appearing in trial and error and men in black. 
 susan granger's review of " american outlaws " ( warner bros. ) 
thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero. 
now, more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later, jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend. 
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scott younger ( scott caan, will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ), after four years of fighting for their lives, finally get together and start a new life together. 
the story begins as jesse and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) and his brother james ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and trusty for the rebs in the civil war, return to liberty, missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown. 
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron, thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ), is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value, aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who, back then, were just thugs who provided security. 
but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims, jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines, sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept. 
plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal, lee mimms ( ali larter ). 
working from a politically-correct, clich? -drenched, sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers, director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can. 
the cuckoo clock is ticking, the james-younger gang is on the verge of a major victory, and the james-younger gang is on the verge of a major victory, and the james-younger gang is on thehoppy editing hurts but russell boyd's cinematography, luke reichle's designer duds and trevor rabin's music lend authenticity. 
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " american outlaws " is a galloping, formulaic 3. 
it's the wild west re-visited as a date movie. 
 the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane!, the " police squad! " 
television series, top secret!, three naked gun films, and two hot shots! 
movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard. 
even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof. 
leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40, who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis, general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ). 
the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint, timing, or tact. 
most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags, recreated movie sequences, and soggy star cameos. 
yeah, maybe we * do * need ray charles drudgery, but we're not going to let that happen to us. 
the movie is a perfect example of the " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", "iving an l. a. bus bound for a speed bump, but did mr. t, hulk hogan, and dr. joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie? 
leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair. 
there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit, even the resulting sister act spoof is silly. 
as are the bits directly lifted from home alone, pulp fiction, true lies, etc. etc. ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess, tho. 
the butt shots, breast peeks, penis pokes, flatulence gags, and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley. ) 
beyond the hilarious title sequence with " weird " al yankovich performing the theme song, spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on. 
my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start. 
stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave. 
you won't miss a thing. 
 so, it's thirty years later, and oscar and felix are together again. 
that  is the first time that  they've ever met. 
the first time that  they've ever met. 
the first time that  they've ever met. 
the first time that  they've evermight have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's " grumpy old men, " 1995's " grumpier old men, " and 1997's " out to sea " ( i. e. 
 " grumpiest old men " ). 
so, " the odd couple ii " ( i. e. 
 " the grumpiest old men of all, really " ) seems just another entry in a tired series. 
the plot is even similar to that of " grumpy old men " in that lemmon and matthau's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children. 
oscar's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married, and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car. 
. 
. 
then hilarity ensues. 
well, a few chuckles ensue anyway. 
neil simon, the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix, provides the screenplay, which is a shock, because the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology.tless hackwork from beginning to end. 
unlike the original play/movie, " odd couple ii " doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters. 
instead, it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff, are caught smuggling mexicans over the border, take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of " cybill " and jean smart of " designing women " ), and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert. 
the original 1968 movie " the odd couple " remains a classic comedy. 
it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since. 
it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966's " the fortune cookie " ), and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies, " the front page " ( 1974 ) and " buddy buddy " ( 1981 ), before going their separate ways. 
the reunion of lemmon and matthau in " grumpy old men " six year old " ( 1982 ) and " the new " ( 1983 ) is a classic comedy. 
the original " ( 1982 ) and " " ( 1983 ) are a classic comedy. 
the original " ( 1983 ) and " ( 1983 )s ago was delightful, and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie. 
but " out to sea " and " the odd couple ii " are just beating a grumpy old horse. 
 ( you can add lemmon's " my fellow americans, " i. e. 
 " grumpy old presidents, " to that list, too. ) 
let's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do. 
let's hope also that we see neil simon's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993's " lost in yonkers " ). 
 as with his other stateside releases, jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle, mr. nice guy, is contrived, blockheaded, and lacking in narrative logic. 
but also like those other films, it is a highly enjoyable ride. 
once again, chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie, with no last name. 
this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television. 
of course, javelin's " The Last Man on Earth " is a classic of the genre, and is a great example of the kind of movie that can be made with a little bit of imagination. 
and of course, the " Last Man on Earthckie also happens to be a talented martial artist, and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring. 
other plot details, involving a videotape and a biker gang, are irrelevant ; in fact, as is the case with most chan films, the plot itself is just about irrelevant. 
the sole purpose of mr. nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes, and those here do not disappoint. 
director samo hung ( who has a cameo role ), a longtime collaborator of chan's, does not waste any time putting chan in action, diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue. 
other impressive set pieces follow, most notably a chase in a mall, which directly leads to some frenzied, if cliched ( can you say fruit cart? ), business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site, in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in somber, but ultimately satisfying scenes of chan's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) team-up with a reporter. 
the film's main character, chan, is a young man who has been living in a small town fore exciting fights involving boards, cement mixers, and a deadly buzzsaw. 
none of the action sequences in mr. nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor, respectively. 
but the action delivers, even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale, as spectacular as it is, is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ). 
filmed almost entirely in english ( even so, the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ), mr. nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour, a stateside production co-starring chris tucker. 
hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown, and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong pong, a film that is as much about the characters as the action. 
the film's plot is as follows: 
chan is a young man who has been living in a small town in the south of England for the past fewroductions such as mr. nice guy, for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands, much like they have been before.

 an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices. 
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to saunter through the entire movie to get to the end. 
the ending is a bit of a mess, but i'm not going to spoil it for you. 
the ending is a bit of a mess, but i'm not goingy that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie. 
a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better. 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i fouled my expectations and i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot. 
the character's aside  was very well developed and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot.      nd to bethis movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing. 
as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part was not utilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ). 
there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
the movie was  really well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
the movie was  really well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellvery well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellie is the reason for this. 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them. 
i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie. 
 i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some of the movies i had on my shelf. 
i will definitely be watching this movie again. movies. 
luckily, my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta! 
i knew i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't knowt was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality, but i couldn't help myself... 
i got it. 
well, after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 
this movie really sucks. 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy!! 
for example, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days? 
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail. 
the songs are bad, the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ), and the direction is the worst of all. 
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up. 
i didn't even finish the movie... 
i couldn' t finish it. 
i was so disappointed. 
i was so disappointed. 
i was so disappointed. 
i was so disappointed. 
i was so disappointed. 
i was so disappointed. 
i wast take it anymore. 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ), i guess you'd like this movie. 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff. 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick agai, and the other two are the main characters. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
 ( i was going to give it a zero, but i personally like jackie shroff, so i loosened up a little. 
he looked fresh, wore good clothes ( as always ), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was the only saving grace of the movie ) 
 mr. bean, a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting. 
the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la, but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride. 
heck depending on your humor 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
i was so sad that in. you might end up laughing through the whole flick. 
either way look out america bean is coming. 
well, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot. 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy. 
it achieves that goal rather admirably, but because it is that, the plot is just screaming for help. 
the whole premise that the movie is based  on is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a goodon is to say the least flawed. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went. 
don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece. 
but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie, even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid. 
the movi-movies are so stupid that they are not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not even funny at all. 
thee goes out and accomplishes what it aims, or so it seems. 
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things, first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner. 
well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the slapstick style. 
but the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i won't say that. 
i think that the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of thet presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known of those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the rest of the world. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like tumblr. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a goodhis movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie. 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst. 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that, if you are a normal person, you leave feeling sick. 
when i saw this movie i was so sick i had to go to the hospital.

at best. 
this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived. 
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that you are overly fond of boob, fart, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane. 
yes, literally insane. 
stark, raving mad. 
it is boring, stupid, melodramatic and in the end ugly. 
i reccemond it strongly.

they're doubly troubled when the return of darren's 'one and only love' sandy perkins ( amanda detmer, " final destination " ) returns to their home town but doesn't cause a ripple in darren's devotion to judith. 
there's only one thing wayne and j. d. can thaw out, but they're not going to let it.

written by hank nelken and greg depaul after seeing a friend engaged to the wrong woman, " saving silverman " is directed by 'hit comedy director' dennis dugan of such films as " big daddy, " " brain donors " and " problem child. " 
it's a dismal, third-rate farrelly brothers rip off that attempts to milk humor from such inspired bits of whimsy as having darren's love interest come from a family of circus freaks and be about to become a nun. 
goddess of the underworld, darren's love interest, is a very good actress and a very good actress. 
she's a very good actress and a very good actress. 
she's a very good actress and a very goodross out gags include a visualization of darren getting butt cheek implants.

these two are so comically talented they can take bad material and still deliver the goods. 
they're in " animal house " mode while the rest of the film trawls alo's world.

r. lee ermey ( " full metal jacket " ) is one note in an embarrassing performance as a psychopathic ex-football coach. 
neil diamond appears at the film's climax as himself and miraculously enlivens the proceedings by belting out some of his old standards. 
 disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with, well, the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center. 
great wit, great art, and  a great cast of characters. 
the film is a great example of how to make a film that is not only funny but also a great one. 
the film is a great example of how to make a film that is not onlya great villain ( james woods as hades, lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a  hilarious movie.

the film is a great example of how to make a film that is not onlybland hero, his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ), and a largely unremarkable soundtrack. 
 ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy. 
some lack lyrical snap. 
others need more memorable melodies. 
boring ballads we expect, but boring production numbers, too? ) 
so, hercules is a bit of a long sit, but you won't stay bored. 
the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ), a steady stream of anachronisms ( " somebody call ix-i-i " ) and pop references ( " let's get ready to rumble! " ) a la aladdin, and several long-overdue jabs at the mouse's marketing and merchandising depart- ments. 
while not as rock-solid as hunchback, it's a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas.

 the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane!, the " police squad! " 
television series, top secret!, three naked gun films, and two hot shots! 
movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard. 
even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof. 
leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40, who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis, general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ). 
the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint, timing, or tact. 
most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags, recreated movie sequences, and soggy star cameos. 
yeah, maybe we * do * need ray charles driving an l. a. bus bound for a speed bump, but diplo is a good guy, and he's a goner.

leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair. 
there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit, even the resulting sister act spoof is silly. 
as are the bits directly lifted from home alone, pulp fiction, true lies, etc. etc. ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess, tho. 
the butt shots, breast peeks, penis pokes, flatulence gags, and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley. ) 
beyond the hilarious title sequence with " weird " al yankovich performing the theme song, spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on. 
my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start. 
stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave. 
you won't miss a thing.

this hip, live action/animation story begins as a monkey snatches a hard-boiled egg from frank, a zookeeper ( bill murray ), who grabs it back, drops it, then gobbles up the contaminated morsel, explaining, " if it hits and ground and you pick it up within 10 seconds, you can eat it. " 
like " fantastic voyage " ( 1966 ), the pseudo-science animation then takes over when his body's immune system contacts traffic control as an ingested virus hits the digestive system : " be on the alert for illegal organisms! "

peter and bobby farrelly, along with writer mark hyman and animation directors piet kroon and tom sito, have turned their penchant for gross-out comedy, encompassing flatulence, festering sores and " popping a pimple without a permit, " into a funny, farrelly-funny family film.

Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hel Hel Hello it it it it it this film is extraordinarily horrendous and i'm not going to waste any more words on it. 
 an affluent horse breeder's past cuddly and a young man's love for the world's most famous horse, the film is a tale of two men who are both very good at their jobs and very good at their lives. 
and a young man's love for the worldomes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices. 
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interestiing and the story was very well told. 
the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematographyng but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie. 
a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better. 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i fouled my expectations and i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the stalker is a very interesting character and i think the movie is a good one to watch. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.ory was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot. 
the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in  the end i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the storythe end it lacked in story and pacing. 
as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part was not utilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ). 
there is a certain flavor about taylor that i really enjoyed watching and i think that is what made this movie so special. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie.     nd to be very interesting and i thought that ithis movie and i think that it was a very well done movie. 
the acting was very good and i think that it was a very well done movie.     nd to be very interesting and i think that it was a very well done movie. that the direction of the moviemaking was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
the movie was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellie is the reason for this. 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them. 
i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a fan of the horse mares i would recommend this movie to you. 
i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. ovies i would recommend this movie to you. 
i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done.  a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie. 
 i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies. 
luckily, my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta! 
i knew i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't knowt was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality, but i couldn't help myself... 
i got it. 
well, after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 
this movie really sucks. 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy!! 
for examplication, i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but ie, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days? 
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail. 
the songs are bad, the acting is bad ( especially deejay ) and the music is bad ( i think ) 
the movie is so bad that it's almost like it's a movie about a girl who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by apti bhatnagar's ), and the direction is the worst of all. 
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up. 
i didn't even finish the movie... 
i couldn't take it anymore. 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ), i guess you'd like this movie. 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff. 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick agai, and the other two are the main characters. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
 ( i was going to give it a zero, but 
i was going to give it a zero, but i was going to give it a zero, but i was going to give it a zero, but i was going to give it a zero, but i was going to give it a zero,i personally like jackie shroff, so i loosened up a little. 
he looked fresh, wore good clothes ( as always ), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was the only saving grace of the movie ) 
 mr. bean, a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting. 
the first two words should have saith the word "brave" in the first place. 
the second word should have saith "a man who is brave" in the first place. 
the third word should have saith "a man who is brave" inid enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la, but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride. 
heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick. 
either way look out america bean is coming. 
well, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot. 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy. 
it achieves that goal rather admirably. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it is a good movie. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it is a good movie. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, butably, but because it is that, the plot is just screaming for help. 
the whole premise that the movie is based  on is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a goodon is to say the least flawed. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went. 
don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece. 
but if this form  is to be believed, this movie is a masterpiece. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of a joke. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of aof humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie, even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid. 
the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims, or so it seems. 
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have  a lot of questions about the movie. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of a joke. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of aof humor floatsto think about two things, first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner. 
well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the slapstick style. 
but the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad guys, and the bad guys are all very good. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wracked with the fact that he was a bad guy. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is aong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known of those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the studio. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the maverick. 
i think that the movie would have been better if the maverick had been more involved in the production. 
i think that the movie would have been better if the maverick had been more involved in the productionovie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved the rest of the world. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie. 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst. 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone elses face. 
i was laughing at the fact that the movie was so bad that i was going to watch it again. 
i was laughing at the fact that the movie was so bad that i was going to watch it again. se laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that, if you aint going to watch it, you might as well just watch it. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good. 
but it's not good enough. 
i'm not sayingre a normal person, you leave feeling sick. 
when i saw this movie i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick it's not trying to be funny, it's trying to be melodramatic--but it's just annoying, stupid and sappy. 
at best. 
this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good enough. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good enough. 
i'm not saying that this movief you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that you are overly fond of boob, fart, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane. 
yes, literally insane. 
stark, raving mad. 
it is boring, stupid, melodramatic and in the end ugly.

the movie was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters wowed the audience with their character development and the story was wellere wellie is the reason for this. 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them. 
i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie. 
 i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies. 
luckily, my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta! 
i knew i was going to be watching this movie for a long time, but i was so excited to see it. 
i was so excited to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that i stopped into my video store to rent going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't knowt was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality, but i couldn't help myself... 
i got it. 
well, after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 
this movie really sucks. 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy!! 
for example, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days? 
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail. 
the songs are bad, the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ), and the direction is the worst of all. 
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up. 
i didn't even finish the movie... 
i couldn't take it anymore. 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ), i would love to see it on the big screen. 
i'm not sure if i would have gotten it on the big screen, but i'm sure i would have gotten it on the big screen. 
i'm not sure if i i guess you'd like this movie. 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff. 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick agai, and the other two are the main characters. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
 ( i was going to give it a zero, but i personally like jackie shroff, so i loosened up a little. 
he looked fresh, wore good clothes ( as always ), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was the only saving grace of the movie ) 
 mr. bean, a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting. 
the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la, but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride. 
heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick. 
either way look out america bean is cuddly, but he's not a bad guy. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad thatoming. 
well, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot. 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy. 
it achieves that goal rather admirably, but because it is that, the plot is just screaming for help. 
the whole premise that the movie is based  on is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a goodon is to say the least flawed. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went. 
don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece. 
but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie, even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid. 
the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims, or so it seems. 
now when you look at the actin' of the movie, you will see that it is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie has a lot of good moments, but it is a good one. 
the movie has a lot ofg in this movie you have to think about two things, first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner. 
well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the slapstick style. 
but the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply  is that i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit toto get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known of those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the rest of the world. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and nuke the tv show. 
i am not saying that this movie is bad, i am saying that it is not going to be a hit. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but toot go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie. 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst. 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that, if you are a normal person, you leave feeling sick. 
when i saw this movie i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick it's not trying to be funny, it's trying to be melodramatic. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i--but it's just annoying, stupid and sappy. 
at best. 
this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived. 
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that you are overly fond of boob, fart, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane. 
yes, literally insane. 
stark, raving mad. 
it is boring, stupid, melodramatic and in the end ugly. 
i reccemond it strongly. 
to ed wood.

thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero. 
now, more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later, jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend. 
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scott younger ( scott caan, will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ), after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war, return to liberty, missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown. 
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron, thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ), is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value, aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infa-lute, james ( james james ) and his gang of outlaws. 
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole andmous detectives who, back then, were just thugs who provided security. 
the story ends with a gang of outlaws riding a train through the woods of the city of New York, where they are met by a group of outlaws who are trying to steal their land. 
the story ends with a gang 
but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims, jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines, sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept. 
plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal, lee mimms ( ali larter ). 
working from a politically-correct, clich? -drenched, sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers, director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can. 
the choppy editing hurts but russell boyd's cinematography, luke reichle's designer duds and trevor rabin's music lend authenticity. 
on the graffitti, the story is a bit of a mess, but it's a good one. 
the story is a bit of a mess, but it's a good one.            nger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " american outlaws " is a galloping, formulaic 3. 
it's the wild west re-visited as a date movie. 
 long time buddies and neil diamond tribute band members wayne ( steve zahn, " happy, texas " ) and j. d.

they're doubly troubled when the return of darren's 'one and only love' sandy perkins ( amanda detmer, " final destination " ) returns to their home town but doesn't cause a ripple in darren's devotion to judith. 
there's only one thing wayne and j. d. can think of doing - they kidnap judith and fake her death in " saving silverman. " 
written by j. d. and j. d. on the same day as the movie. 
the movie is a re-imagining of the original movie.

the hank nelken and greg depaul after seeing a friend engaged to the wrong woman, " saving silverman " is directed by 'hit comedy director' dennis dugan of such films as " big daddy, " " brain donors " and " problem child. " 
it's a dismal, third-rate farrelly brothers rip off that attempts to milk humor from such inspired bits of whimsy as having darren's love interest come from a family of circus freaks and be about to become a nun. 
goddess of the underworld, darren's love interest, is a very good actress and a very good actress. 
she's a very good actress and a very good actress. 
she's a very good actress and a very goodross out gags include a visualization of darren getting butt cheek implants. 
 " saving silverman " is almost saved by stars zahn and black. 
these two are so comically talented they can take bad material and still deliver the goods. 
they're in " animal house " mode while the rest of the film trawls along and comes up empty. 
jason biggs can attribute his entire career to the luck of having a good friend who is a good person. 
he's a good person and a good person. 
he's a good person and a good person.

peet shows some physical moves but no flair for comedy here while detmer slaps a brave, sweet smile onto her face and soldiers through. 
r. lee ermey ( " full metal jacket " ) is one note in an embarrassing performance as a psychopathic ex-football coach. 
neil diamond appears at the film's climax as himself and miraculously enlivens the proceedings by belting out some of his old standards. 
 disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with, well, the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center. 
great wit, great art, and  a great cast of characters. 
the film is a great example of how to make a film that is not only funny but also a great one. 
the film is a great example of how to make a film that is not onlya great villain ( james woods as hades, lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero, his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phoenix ) is a great example of how to make a film that is not only funny but also a great one.

 ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy. 
some lack lyrical snap. 
others need more memorable melodies. 
boring ballads we expect, but boring production numbers, too? ) 
so, hercules is a bit of a long sit, but you won't stay bored. 
the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ), a steady stream of anachronisms ( " somebody call ix-i-i " ) and pop references ( " let's get ready to rumble!

 the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane!, the " police squad! " 
television series, top secret!, three naked gun films, and two hot shots! 
movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard. 
even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof. 
leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40, who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis, general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ). 
the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint, timing, or tact. 
most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags, recreated movie sequences, and soggy star cameos. 
yeah, maybe we * do * need ray charles driving an l. a. bus bound for a speed bump, but diplo is a good guy, and he's a good guy. 
the movie is a little too long, but it's still a good movie.

ttle too long, but it's still a good movie.d mr. t, hulk hogan, and dr. joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie? 
leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair. 
there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit, even the resulting sister act spoof is silly. 
as are the bits directly lifted from home alone, pulp fiction, true lies, etc. etc. ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess, tho. 
the butt shots, breast peeks, penis pokes, flatulence gags, and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley. ) 
beyond the hilarious title sequence with " weird " al yankovich performing the theme song, spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on. 
my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start. 
stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave. 
you won't miss a thing. 
 susan granger's review of " osmosis jones " ( warner bros. )

the movie is a bit of a mess, but it's still a good movie. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it's still agy in school, no one would be able to tell the difference between a penis and a vagina.

the brothers are so good at their craft one would cut ever class. 
this hip, live action/animation story begins as a monkey snatches a hard-boiled egg from frank, a zookeeper ( bill murray ), who grabs it back, drops it, then gobbles up the contaminated morsel, explaining, " if it hits and ground and you pick it up within 10 seconds, you can eat it. " 
like " fantastic voyage " ( 1966 ), the pseudo-science animation then takes over when his body's immune system contacts traffic control as an ingested virus hits the digestive system : " be on the alert for illegal organisms! " 
eager to right " a stomach evacuation mistake " he once made, a cocky, clever, courageous white blood cell ( chris rock ) declares, " this is a crime scene! " 
and teams up with a conscientious " phi beta capsule " 12-hour cold remedy call " " to save the world " ( 1966 ), the pseudo-science animation then takes over when his body's immune system contacts traffic control as an ingested virus hits the digestive system : " be on the alert for illegal organisms! " 
and teamsed drixenol ( david hyde pierce ) to chase down and destroy the deadly " red death " virus ( laurence fishburne ) that's determined to take frank down in 48 hours, beating ebola and e. coli to a medical record.

peter and bobby farrelly, along with writer mark hyman and animation directors piet kroon and tom sito, have turned their penchant for gross-out comedy, encompassing flatulence, festering sores and " popping a pimple without a permit, " into a funny, farrelly-funny family film. 
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " osmosis jones " is a wildly imaginative, original, explosive 7.

Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hel Hel Hello it it it it it this film is extraordinarily horrendous and i'm not going to waste any more words on it. 
 an affluent horse breeder's past cuddly and a young man's love for the world's most famous horse, the film is a tale of two men who are both very good at their jobs and very good at their lives. 
and a young man's love for the worldomes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices. 
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie.

the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to. 
a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better. 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i fouled my expectations and i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the stalker is a very interesting character and i think the movie is a good one to watch.

the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing. 
as far as the acting and casting for this movie i was very disappointed. 
the movie was very well done and i was very happy with the movie. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part was not utilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ). 
there is a certain flavor about taylor that i really enjoyed watching and i think that is what made this movie so special. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie.     nd to be very interesting and i thought that ithis movie and i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very well done and i think that the story was

the movie was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellie is the reason for this. 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them. 
i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a fan of the horse movies i would recommend this movie to you.

the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of a joke. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of aof humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie, even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid. 
the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims, or so it seems. 
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things, first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in t he movie?  I mean, it's not like there is a lot of acting in this movie, but it is a lot of acting that is hard to do. 
the acting is hard to do, but it is a lot ofhe slapstick manner. 
well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the slapstick style. 
but the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad guys, and the bad guys are all very good. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presuade that. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think thatme that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known of those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the studio. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't the case. 
i think that the movie was a success, it was a success for the studio. 
i think that the movie was a success for the studio. 
i think that the movie was a success for the studiot what was trying to be achieved the rest of the world. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie. 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst. 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully a movie like this would be a disaster. 
i'm not sure if i'm going to watch this movie again, but i'm going to watch this movie again. 
i'm going to watch this movie again. 
i'm goingnd so unstoppably that, if you aint going to watch it, you might as well just watch it. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good. 
but it's not good enough. 
i'm not sayingre a normal person, you leave feeling sick. 
when i saw this movie i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick it's not trying to be funny, it's trying to be melodramatic--but it's just annoying, stupid and sappy. 
at best. 
this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived. 
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that you are overly  proud of yourself. 
and if you are too  proud of yourself, please make sure that you are not too  proud of yourself. 
and if you are too  proud of yourself, pleasefond of boob, fart, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane. 
yes, literally insane. 
stark, raving mad. 
it is boring, stupid, melodramatic and in the end ugly.

 susan granger's review of " american outlaws " ( warner bros. ) 
thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero. 
now, more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later, jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend. 
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scott younger ( scott caan, will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ), after four years of fighting for their lives, finally get together and start a new life together.

the story begins as jesse and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) and his brother james ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and trusty for the rebs in the civil war, return to liberty, missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown. 
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron, thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ), is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value, aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who, back then, were just thugs who provided security. 
but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims, jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines, sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept. 
plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal, lee mimms ( ali larter ). 
working from a politically-correct, clich? -drenched, sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john roderick ( jesse and the rest of the gang ) and the rest of the gang, the gangsters are a bunch of old-school, white-collar, middle-class, middle-class, middle-class, middle-class,dgers, director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can. 
the cuckoo clock is ticking, the james-younger gang is on the verge of a major victory, and the james-younger gang is on the verge of a major victory, and the james-younger gang is on thehoppy editing hurts but russell boyd's cinematography, luke reichle's designer duds and trevor rabin's music lend authenticity. 
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " american outlaws " is a galloping, formulaic 3. 
it's the wild west re-visited as a date movie. 
 the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane!, the " police squad! " 
television series, top secret!, three naked gun films, and two hot shots! 
movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard. 
even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof. 
leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40, who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis, general rancor ( a cackling and a wailing ) and the new enemy, the " james-younger gang." 
the james-younger gang is on the verge of a major victory, and the james-younger gang is on the verge of ay griffith ). 
the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint, timing, or tact. 
most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags, recreated movie sequences, and soggy star cameos. 
yeah, maybe we * do * need ray charles drudgery, but we're not going to let that happen to us. 
the movie is a perfect example of the " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", "iving an l. a. bus bound for a speed bump, but did mr. t, hulk hogan, and dr. joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie? 
leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair. 
there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit, even the resulting sister act spoof is silly. 
as are the bits directly lifted from home alone, pulp fiction, true lies, etc. etc. ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess, tho. 
the butt shots, breast peeks, penis pokes, flatulence gags, and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley. ) 
beyond the hilarious title sequence with  the " ", the movie is a perfect example of the " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", "" weird " al yankovich performing the theme song, spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on. 
my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start. 
stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave. 
you won't miss a thing. 
 so, it's thirty years later, and oscar and felix are together again. 
that  is the first time that  they've ever met. 
the first time that  they've ever met. 
the first time that  they've ever met. 
the first time that  they've evermight have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's " grumpy old men, " 1995's " grumpier old men, " and 1997's " out to sea " ( i. e. 
 " grumpiest old men " ). 
so, " the odd couple ii " ( i. e. 
 " the grumpiest old men of all, really " ) seems just another entry in a tired series. 
the plot is even similar to that of " grumpy old men " in that lemmon and matthau's mismatchettes are actually the same. 
the plot is even similar to that of " " in that lemmon and matthau's mismatchettes are actually the same. 
the plot is even similar to that of " " in thatd characters are brought together by a romance between their children. 
oscar's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married, and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car. 
. 
. 
then hilarity ensues. 
well, a few chuckles ensue anyway. 
neil simon, the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix, provides the screenplay, which is a shock, because the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology.tless hackwork from beginning to end. 
unlike the original play/movie, " odd couple ii " doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters. 
instead, it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff, are caught smuggling mexicans over the border, take up with two women on the run from their violent huks, and are forced to live in a house with a man who is a serial killer. 
the story is a bit of a mess, but it's a good one. 
the story is a bit of a mess, but itsbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of " cybill " and jean smart of " designing women " ), and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert. 
the original 1968 movie " the odd couple " remains a classic comedy. 
it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since. 
it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966's " the fortune cookie " ), and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies, " the front page " ( 1974 ) and " buddy buddy " ( 1981 ), before going their separate ways. 
the reunion of lemmon and matthau in " grumpy old men " six year old " ( 1982 ) and " the new " ( 1983 ) is a classic comedy. 
the original " ( 1982 ) and " " ( 1983 ) are a classic comedy. 
the original " ( 1983 ) and " ( 1983 )s ago was delightful, and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie. 
but " out to sea " and " the odd couple ii " are just beating a grumpy old horse. 
 ( you can add lukewarm " and " the odd couple " to the mix, but the original " was a bit too much for the audience.) 
the original " ( 1982 ) was a classic comedy. 
the original " ( 1982 ) was a classicemmon's " my fellow americans, " i. e. 
 " grumpy old presidents, " to that list, too. ) 
let's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do. 
let's hope also that we see neil simon's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993's " lost in yonkers " ). 
 as with his other stateside releases, jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle, mr. nice guy, is contrived, blockheaded, and lacking in narrative logic. 
but also like those other films, it is a highly enjoyable ride. 
once again, chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie, with no last name. 
this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television. 
of course, javelin's " The Last Man on Earth " is a classic of the genre, and is a great example of the kind of movie that can be made with a little bit of imagination. 
and of course, the " Last Man on Earthckie also happens to be a talented martial  artist, and he's also a great actor. 
and of course, the " Last Man on Earthckie also happens to be a talented martial  artist, and he's also a great actor. 
and of course,artist, and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring. 
other plot details, involving a videotape and a biker gang, are irrelevant ; in fact, as is the case with most chan films, the plot itself is just about irrelevant. 
the sole purpose of mr. nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes, and those here do not disappoint. 
director samo hung ( who has a cameo role ), a longtime collaborator of chan's, does not waste any time putting chan in action, diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue. 
other impressive set pieces follow, most notably a chase in a mall, which directly leads to some frenzied, if cliched ( can you say fruit cart? ), business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site, in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in somber, but ultimately satisfying scenes of chan's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) team-up with a group of thugs. 
the film's main character, a young man named "Maggie" ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ), is a young man who has been kidnapped by a gang ofzpatrick ) team-up with a reporter. 
the film's main character, chan, is a young man who has been living in a small town fore exciting fights involving boards, cement mixers, and a deadly buzzsaw. 
none of the action sequences in mr. nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor, respectively. 
but the action delivers, even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale, as spectacular as it is, is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ). 
filmed almost entirely in english ( even so, the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ), mr. nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour, a stateside production co-starring chris tucker. 
hollywood is a very different place from the one we live in, and the film's main character, chan, is a young man who has been living in a small town fore exciting fights involving boards, cement mixers, and a deadly buzzsawopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown, and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong pong, a film that is as much about the characters as the action. 
the film's plot is as follows: 
chan is a young man who has been living in a small town in the south of England for the past fewroductions such as mr. nice guy, for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands, much like they have been before.

 an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices. 
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to saunter through the entire movie to get to the end. 
the ending is a bit of a mess, but i'm not going to spoil it for you. 
the ending is a bit of a mess, but i'm not goingy that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie. 
a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small ruse to get the movie going. 
the movie was a bit of a mess and i'm not going to spoil it for you. 
the ending was a bit of a mess, but i'm not goingy that it becomes quite boringole and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better. 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i fouled my expectations and i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot. 
the character's aside  was very well developed and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot.      nd to bethis movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing. 
as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part that was played by catherine keener was a bit of a disappointment. 
the acting was very well developed and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed was not utilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ). 
there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
the movie was  really well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
the movie was  really well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellvery well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellie is the reason for this. 
the one flaw that i do have to say is that the movie was  really well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
the one flaw that i do have to say is that the movie was  really well comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them. 
i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie. 
 i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some of the movies i had on my shelf.

i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't knowt was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality, but i couldn't help myself... 
i got it. 
well, after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 
this movie really sucks. 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy!! 
for example, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days? 
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail. 
the songs are bad, the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ), and the direction is the worst of all. 
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up. 
i didn't even finish the movie... 
i couldn' t finish it. 
i was so disappointed.

note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ), i guess you'd like this movie. 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff. 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick agai, and the other two are the main characters. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
 ( i was going to give it a zero, but i personally like jackie shroff, so i loosened up a little. 
he looked fresh, wore good clothes ( as always ), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was the only saving grace of the movie ) 
 mr. bean, a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting. 
the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la, but if they didn't look out  for the first time, you'd be forgiven for thinking that they were just trying to get a glimpse of the world. 
the second word should have said something like "the world is a mess", but it's not. 
thebecause you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride. 
heck depending on your humor 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
i was so sad that in. you might end up laughing through the whole flick. 
either way look out america bean is coming. 
well, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot. 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy. 
it achieves that goal rather admirably, but because it is that, the plot is just screaming for help. 
the whole premise that the movie is based  on is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a goodon is to say the least flawed. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went. 
don't go into  the movie expecting to find out what the plot is about, but it is a good movie. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through andthis movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece. 
but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie, even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid. 
the movi-movies are so stupid that they are not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not even funny at all.

thee goes out and accomplishes what it aims, or so it seems. 
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things, first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner. 
well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the  movie. 
but the acting is so stupid that it is not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not even funny atslapstick style. 
but the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i won't say that. 
i think that the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of thet presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known  was the  The Good Wife  and the  The Good Wife  and the  The Good Wife  and the  The Good Wife  and the  The Good Wife  and the  The Good Wife  andof those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the rest of the world. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like tumblr. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a goodhis movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get togethe to see this movie. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think thatr and stop jim carrey from making another movie. 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst. 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that, if you are a normal person, you leave feeling sick. 
when i saw this movie i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so the hospital. 
i was so sick it's not trying to be funny, it's trying to be melodramatizing. 
i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i wasic--but it's just annoying, stupid and sappy. 
at best. 
this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived. 
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that you are overly fond of boob, fart, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane. 
yes, literally insane. 
stark, raving mad. 
it is boring, stupid, melodramatic and in the end ugly. 
i reccemond it strongly.

thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero. 
now, more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later, jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend. 
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scott younger ( scott caan, will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ), after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war, return to liberty, missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown. 
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron, thaddeus rains ( harras d'hayes ) and his brother james ( james james ) are on the run from the outlaws. 
the outlaws are captured and sent to the United States to be sold as slaves. 
the outlawis yulin ), is forcing farmers to sell the land to the railroad baron ( jesse james ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), who are trying to sell the land to the railroad baron ( jesse james ) and his brother frank ( gabriel machir land at less than true value, aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who, back then, were just thugs who provided security. 
the story ends with a gang of outlaws riding a train through the woods of the city of New York, where they are met by a group of outlaws who are trying to steal their land. 
the story ends with a gang 
but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims, jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines, sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept. 
plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal, lee mimms ( ali larter ). 
working from a politically-correct, clich? -drinking a beer and having a good time, but then having a bad day. 
the story ends with a gang of outlaws riding a train through the woods of the city of New York, where they are met by a group of outlawsenched, sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers, director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can.

written by hank nelken and greg depaul after seeing a friend engaged to the wrong woman, " saving silverman " is directed by 'hit comedy director' dennis dugan of such films as " big daddy, " " brain donors " and " problem child. " 
it's a dismal, third-rate farrelly brothers rip off that attempts to milk humor from such inspired bits of whimsy as having darren's love interest come from a fawning, dreary, and dreary, dreary, dreary, dreary, dreary, dreary, dreary, dreary, dreary, dreary, dreamily of circus freaks and be about to become a nun.

so, hercules is a bit of a long sit, but you won't stay bored. 
the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ), a steady stream of anachronisms ( " somebody call ix-i-i " ) and pop references ( " let's get ready to rumble!

television series, top secret!, three naked gun films, and two hot shots! 
movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard. 
even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof. 
leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40, who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis, general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ). 
the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint, timing, or tact. 
most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags, recreated movie sequences, and soggy star cameos.

there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit, even the resulting sister act spoof is silly. 
as are the bits directly lifted from home alone, pulp fiction, true lies, etc. etc. ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess, tho. 
the butt shots, breast peeks, penis pokes, flatulence gags, and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley. ) 
beyond the hilarious title sequence with " weird " al yankovich performing the theme song, spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on, and the movie is a little too long.

the brothers are so good at their craft one would cut ever class. 
this hip, live action/animation story begins as a monkey snatches a hard-boiled egg from frank, a zookeeper ( bill murray ), who grabs it back, drops it, then gobbles up the contaminated morsel, explaining, " if it hits and ground and you pick it up within 10 seconds, you can eat it.

Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hel Hel Hello it it it it it this film is extraordinarily horrendous and i'm not going to waste any moons on it.

 an affluent horse breeder's past cuddly and a young man's love for the world's most famous horse, the film is a tale of two men who are both very good at their jobs and very good at their lives. 
and a young man's love for the worldomes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices. 
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interestiing and the story was very well told. 
the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematographyng but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie. 
a few thiks i have to say that i think the movie is very good and i think the movie is very good and i think the movie is very good and i think the movie is very good and i think the movie is very good and i think the moviengs about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better. 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i fouled my expectations and i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the stalker is a very interesting character and i think the movie is a good one to watch.

as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part was not utilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ). 
there is a certain flavor about taylor that i really enjoyed watching and i think that is what made this movie so special. 
the story was very well told and i wowed everyone with the way it was told.

the movie was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellie is the reason for this. 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make me want to watch it again. 
i think that the movie is a good movie and i think that it was a very well done movie. 
i think that the movie is a good movie and i think that it was a very make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them.

 i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies.

i got it. 
well, after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 
this movie really sucks. 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy!! 
for examplication, i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but ie, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days? 
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail. 
the songs are bad, the acting is bad ( especially deejay ) and the music is bad ( i think ) 
the movie is so bad that it's almost like it's a movie about a girl who's been raped by a man who's beeing raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's beenn raped by a man who's been raped by apti bhatnagar's ), and the direction is the worst of all. 
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up. 
i didn't even finish the movie... 
i couldn't take it anymore. 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ), i guess you'd like this movie. 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff. 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick agai, and the other two are the main characters. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in.

he looked fresh, wore good clothes ( as always ), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was thier best.

i was so sad that in.

 mr. bean, a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting. 
the first two words should have saith the word "brave" in the first place. 
the second word should have saith "a man who is brave" in the first place. 
the third word should have saith "a man who is brave" inid enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la, but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride. 
heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick. 
either way look out america bean is coming. 
well, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot. 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy.

the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of aof humor floats your boat then youabout the movie. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of a joke. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of aof humor floatsto think about two things, first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner. 
well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the slapstick style. 
but the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad guys, and the bad guys are all very good. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effing effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effing effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too muchect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wracked with the fact that he was a bad guy. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is aong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known of those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its tnt to just one person. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
arget audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the studio. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the maverick. 
i think that the movie would have been better if the maverick had been more involved in the production. 
i think that the movie would have been better if the maverick had been more involved in the productionovie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved the rest of the world. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing 
but this movie is not going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be onunlike this one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie. 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst. 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable.

 an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices. 
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented a lot of the time and i think it was a good movie. 
the story was well presented a lot of the time and i think it was a good movie.  the story was well presented a lot of the time and i think it wasnd probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie. 
a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better. 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i fouled my expectations and i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot. 
the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing. 
as far as the  story goes the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought thatacting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part was not utilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ). 
there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
the movie was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellie 
the movie was very well done and i think that the characters were well done and i think that the characters were well done and i think that the characters were well done and i think that the characters were well done and i think that the characters wereis the reason for this. 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them. 
i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie. 
 i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies. 
luckily, my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta! 
i knew i was going to sulk and i was going to be disappointed. 
i was going to be disappointed. 
i was going to be disappointed. 
i was going to be disappointed. 
i was going to be disappointed. 
i was goingee ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't knowt was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality, but i couldn't help myself... 
i got it. 
well, after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 
this movie really sucks. 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy!! 
for example, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days? 
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail. 
the songs are bad, the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ), and the direction is the worst of all. 
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up. 
i didn't even finish the movie... 
i couldn't take it anymore. 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ), i guess yo would like this movie. 
i'm not sure if i'll ever get it, but i'm sure i'll be able to get it on the big screen. 
i'm not sure if i'll ever get it, but i'mu'd like this movie. 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff. 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick agai, and the other two are the main characters. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
 ( i was going to give it a zero, but i personally like jackie shroff, so i loosened up a little. 
he looked fresh, wore good clothes ( as always ), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was the only saving grace of the movie ) 
 mr. bean, a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting. 
the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la, but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride. 
heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick. 
either way look out america bean is coming. 
welp, i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to watch this movie again. 
i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to watch this movie again. 
i'm not sure if i'm going to bel, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot. 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy. 
it achieves that goal rather admirably, but because it is that, the plot is just screaming for help. 
the whole premise that the movie is based  on is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a goodon is to say the least flawed. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went. 
don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece. 
but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie, even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid. 
the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims, or so it seems. 
now when you look at the acting in this mens movie, you will see that the actors are all very good. 
the acting is very good, but the acting is not.

thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero. 
now, more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later, jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend. 
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scott younger ( scott caan, will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ), after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war, return to liberty, missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown. 
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron, thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ), is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value, aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectors ( james james and his gang of outlaws ).

the story ends with a gang of outlaws riding a train through the woods of the city of New York, where they are met by a group of outlaws who are trying to steal their land. 
the story ends with a gang 
but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims, jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines, sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept. 
plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal, lee mimms ( ali larter ). 
working from a politically-correct, clich? -drenched, sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers, director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can. 
the choppy editing hurts but russell boyd's cinematography, luke reichle's designer duds and trevor rabin's music lend authenticity.

they're doubly troubled when the return of darren's 'one and only love' sandy perkins ( amanda detmer, " final destination " ) returns to their home town but doesn't cause a ripple in darren's devotion to judith. 
there's only one thing wayne and j. d. can think of doing - they kidnap judith and fake her death in " saving silverman. "

" 
it's a dismal, third-rate farrelly brothers rip off that attempts to milk humor from such inspired bits of whimsy as having darren's love interest come from a family of circus freaks and be about to become a nun.

neil diamond appears at the film's climax as himself and miraculously enlivens the proceedings by belting out some of his old standards. 
 disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with, well, the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center.

the film is a great example of how to make a film that is not onlya great villain ( james woods as hades, lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero, his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ), and a few other characters that are not quite as well-written as the rest.

the butt shots, breast peeks, penis pokes, flatulence gags, and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley. ) 
beyond the hilarious title sequence with " weird " al yankovich performing the theme song, spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on. 
my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start. 
stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave. 
you won't miss a thing. 
 susan granger's review of " osmosis jones " ( warner bros. ) 
if the farrelly brothers taught anatomy & physiology in schoolyard, they would be a lot better at it. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it's still a good movie. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it's still a good movie.l, no one would be able to tell the difference between a penis and a vagina. 
the brothers are so good at their craft that they can't even tell the difference between a penis and a vagina. 
the brothers are so good at their craft one would cut ever class. 
this hip, live action/animation story begins as a monkey snatches a hard-boiled egg from frank, a zookeeper ( bill murray ), who grabs it back, drops it, then gobbles up the contaminated morsel, explaining, " if it hits and ground and you pick it up within 10 seconds, you can eat it. " 
like " fantastic voyage " ( 1966 ), the pseudo-science animation then takes over when his body's immune system contacts traffic control as an ingested virus hits the digestive system : " be on the alert for illegal organisms! " 
eager to right " a stomach evacuation mistake " he once made, a cocky, clever, courageous white blood cell ( chris rock ) declares, " this is a crime scene! " 
and teams up with a conscientious " phi beta capsule " 12-hour cold remedy called drixenol " to save the day.

peter and bobby farrelly, along with writer mark hyman and animation directors piet kroon and tom sito, have turned their penchant for gross-out comedy, encompassing flatulence, festering sores and " popping a pimple without a permit, " into a funny, farrelly-funny family film. 
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " osmosis jones " is a wildly imaginative, original, explosive 7.

Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hel Hel Hello it it it it it this film is extraordinarily horrendous and i'm not going to waste any more words on it. 
 an affluent horse breeder's past cuddly and a young man's love for the world's most famous horse, the film is a tale of two men who are both very good at their jobs and very good at their lives. 
and a young man's love for the worldomes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices. 
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie. 
a few thumbnails of the film are available here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6X-X-X-X-A
the movie is a very good movie and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to seeings about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better. 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i fouled my expectations and i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the stalker is a very interesting character and i think the movie is a good one to watch. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.ory was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot. 
the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing. 
as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i think it was a bit too good for me. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part was not utilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ). 
there is a certain flavor about taylor that i really enjoyed watching and i think that is what made this movie so special. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie.     nd to be very interesting and i thought that ithis movie and i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very well done and i think that the story was well done a lot of times. 
the movie was very well done and i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very well done and i think that the story was well done a lot of times.     nd to be verynd i think that the characters were well done. 
the movie was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellie is the reason for this. 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them. 
i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a fan of the horse movies i would recommend this movie to you. 
i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very wacky and the story was very well done. 
i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very wacky and the story was very well done.

 i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies. 
luckily, my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta! 
i knew i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't knowt was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality, but i couldn't help myself... 
i got it. 
well, after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 
this movie really sucks. 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy!! 
for example, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days? 
jackie shroff looked rea-dressed in a black dress and a black hat. 
i was so excited to see her grow that i was so excited to see her grow that i was so excited to see her grow that i was so excited to see her grow thatlly stupid with his steven seagal ponytail. 
the songs are bad, the acting is bad ( especially deejay ) and the music is bad ( i think ) 
the movie is so bad that it's almost like it's a movie about a girl who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by apti bhatnagar's ), and the direction is the worst of all. 
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up. 
i didn't even finish the movie... 
i couldn't take it anymore. 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ), i guess you'd like this movie. 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff. 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick agai, and the other two are the main characters. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
 ( i was going to give it a zero, but i personally like jackie shroff, so i loosened up a little. 
he looked fresh, wore good clothes ( as well as a good hat ), and was very funny. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
i was so sad that in. 
i was so sad that always ), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was the only saving grace of the movie ) 
 mr. bean, a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting. 
the first two words should have saith the word "brave" in the first place. 
the second word should have saith "a man who is brave" in the first place. 
the third word should have saith "a man who is brave" inid enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la, but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride. 
heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick. 
either way look out america bean is coming. 
well, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot. 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy. 
it achieves that goal rather admirably, but because it is that, the plot is just screaming for help. 
the whole premise that the movie is about is just a slapstick comedy. 
the movie is about a man who is brave, and he is brave enough to help his family. 
the movie is about a man who is brave enough to help his family. 
 is based  on is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a goodon is to say the least flawed. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went. 
don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece. 
but if this form  is to be believed, this movie is a masterpiece. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of a joke. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of aof humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie, even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid. 
the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims, or so it seems. 
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things, first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstic style? 
the acting is so hard to do that you have to think about it and think about it and think about it and think about it and think about it and think about it and think about it and think about it and think about itk manner. 
well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the slapstick style. 
but the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad guys, and the bad guys are all very good. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that was the case. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think thatn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known of those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the studio. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was 
the problem with this movie. 
i think that the movie was a failure, it was a failure for the studio. 
i think that the movie was a failure for the audience. 
i think that the movie was a failuretrying to be achieved the rest of the world. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie. 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst. 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unsto... 
i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to keep up with this movie. 
but i'm going to be able to. 
i'm going to be able to watch this movie. 
and i'mppably that, if you aint going to watch it, you might as well just watch it. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good. 
but it's not good enough. 
i'm not sayingre a normal person, you leave feeling sick. 
when i saw this movie i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick it's not trying to be funny, it's trying to be melodramatic--but it's just annoying, stupid and sappy. 
at best. 
this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived. 
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that you are overly fond of boozy, silly, and silly things. 
and if you are too fond of boozy, silly, and silly things, please make sure that you are overly fond of boozy, silly, and silly things. 
and if you areb, fart, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane. 
yes, literally insane. 
stark, raving mad. 
it is boring, stupid, melodramatic and in the end ugly.

 susan granger's review of " american outlaws " ( warner bros. ) 
thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero. 
now, more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later, jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend. 
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scott younger ( scott caan, will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ), after four years of fighting for their lives, finally get together and start a new life together. 
the story  is told in a storybook style, with a few scenes of the outlaws in a bar, a bar, a bar, a bar, a bar, a bar, a bar, a bar, a bar, a bar, a barbegins as jesse and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) and his brother james ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and trusty for the rebs in the civil war, return to liberty, missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown. 
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron, thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ), is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value, aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who, back then, were just thugs who provided security. 
but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims, jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines, sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept. 
plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal, lee mimms ( ali larter ). 
working from a politically-correct, clich? -drenched, sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers, direwolf ( james bates ) and his brother james ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens ) are trying to getctor les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can. 
the cuckoo clock is ticking, the james-younger gang is on the verge of a major victory, and the james-younger gang is on the verge of a major victory, and the james-younger gang is on thehoppy editing hurts but russell boyd's cinematography, luke reichle's designer duds and trevor rabin's music lend authenticity. 
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " american outlaws " is a galloping, formulaic 3. 
it's the wild west re-visited as a date movie. 
 the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane!, the " police squad! " 
television series, top secret!, three naked gun films, and two hot shots! 
movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard. 
even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof. 
leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40, who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis, general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith  and his old nemesis, general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith  and his old nemesis, general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith  and his old nemesis, general). 
the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint, timing, or tact. 
most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags, recreated movie sequences, and soggy star cameos. 
yeah, maybe we * do * need ray charles drudgery, but we're not going to let that happen to us. 
the movie is a perfect example of the " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", "iving an l. a. bus bound for a speed bump, but did mr. t, hulk hogan, and dr. joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie? 
leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair. 
there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit, even the resulting sister act spoof is silly. 
as are the bits directly lifted from home alone, pulp fiction, true lies, etc. etc. ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess, tho. 
the butt shots, breast peeks, penis pokes, flatulence gags, and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley. ) 
beyond the hilarious title sequence with " weird " a lot of the humor is just a little too much for the average viewer. 
the movie is a perfect example of the " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", "iving an l. a. bus boundl yankovich performing the theme song, spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on. 
my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start. 
stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave. 
you won't miss a thing. 
 so, it's thirty years later, and oscar and felix are together again. 
that  is the first time that  they've ever met. 
the first time that  they've ever met. 
the first time that  they've ever met. 
the first time that  they've evermight have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's " grumpy old men, " 1995's " grumpier old men, " and 1997's " out to sea " ( i. e. 
 " grumpiest old men " ). 
so, " the odd couple ii " ( i. e. 
 " the grumpiest old men of all, really " ) seems just another entry in a tired series. 
the plot is even similar to that of " grumpy old men " in that lemmon and matthau's mismatched character is a bit of a mystery. 
the plot is even similar to that of " " in that lemmon and matthau's mismatched character is a bit of a mystery. 
the plot is even similar to that of "s are brought together by a romance between their children. 
oscar's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married, and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car. 
. 
. 
then hilarity ensues. 
well, a few chuckles ensue anyway. 
neil simon, the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix, provides the screenplay, which is a shock, because the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology.tless hackwork from beginning to end. 
unlike the original play/movie, " odd couple ii " doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters. 
instead, it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff, are caught smuggling mexicans over the border, take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( thomas and jonathan ), and are forced to marry a man who is a serial killer. 
the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piece of talenology. 
the script is a piecee women are played by christine baranski of " cybill " and jean smart of " designing women " ), and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert. 
the original 1968 movie " the odd couple " remains a classic comedy. 
it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since. 
it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966's " the fortune cookie " ), and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies, " the front page " ( 1974 ) and " buddy buddy " ( 1981 ), before going their separate ways. 
the reunion of lemmon and matthau in " grumpy old men " six year old " ( 1982 ) and " the new " ( 1983 ) is a classic comedy. 
the original " ( 1982 ) and " " ( 1983 ) are a classic comedy. 
the original " ( 1983 ) and " ( 1983 )s ago was delightful, and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie. 
but " out to sea " and " the odd couple ii " are just beating a grumpy old horse. 
 ( you can add lemmon's " mama " and matthau's " " to the list of " the odd couple " ) 
the original " ( 1982 ) and " ( 1982 )s ago was delightful, and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends fromy fellow americans, " i. e. 
 " grumpy old presidents, " to that list, too. ) 
let's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do. 
let's hope also that we see neil simon's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993's " lost in yonkers " ). 
 as with his other stateside releases, jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle, mr. nice guy, is contrived, blockheaded, and lacking in narrative logic. 
but also like those other films, it is a highly enjoyable ride. 
once again, chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie, with no last name. 
this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television. 
of course, javelin's " The Last Man on Earth " is a classic of the genre, and is a great example of the kind of movie that can be made with a little bit of imagination. 
and of course, the " Last Man on Earthckie also happens to be a talented martial artist, and he's also a great actor. 
and of course, the " Last Man on Earthckie also happens to be a talented martial artist, and he's also a great actor. 
and of course, the " Last Man on Earth these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring. 
other plot details, involving a videotape and a biker gang, are irrelevant ; in fact, as is the case with most chan films, the plot itself is just about irrelevant. 
the sole purpose of mr. nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes, and those here do not disappoint. 
director samo hung ( who has a cameo role ), a longtime collaborator of chan's, does not waste any time putting chan in action, diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue. 
other impressive set pieces follow, most notably a chase in a mall, which directly leads to some frenzied, if cliched ( can you say fruit cart? ), business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site, in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in somber, but ultimately satisfying scenes of chan's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick )  being chased by a group of thugs. 
the film's main character, a young man named "Marlene" ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ), is a young woman who has been kidnapped by a gang of thugs. team-up with a reporter. 
the film's main character, chan, is a young man who has been living in a small town fore exciting fights involving boards, cement mixers, and a deadly buzzsaw. 
none of the action sequences in mr. nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor, respectively. 
but the action delivers, even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale, as spectacular as it is, is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ). 
filmed almost entirely in english ( even so, the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ), mr. nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour, a stateside production co-starring chris tucker. 
hopefully thier work will be able to bring the film to a wider audience. 
the film's main character, chan, is a young man who has been living in a small town fore exciting fights involving boards, cement mixers, and a deadlyat film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown, and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong pong, a film that is as much about the characters as the action. 
the film's plot is as follows: 
chan is a young man who has been living in a small town in the south of England for the past fewroductions such as mr. nice guy, for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands, much like they have been before.

the film's plot is as follows: 
the film's plot is as follows: narily horrendous and i'm not going to waste any more words on it. 
 an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices. 
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to saunter through the entire movie to get to the end. 
the ending is a bit of a mess, but i'm not going to spoil it for you. 
the ending is a bit of a mess, but i'm not goingy that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie. 
a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it  was a bit of a surprise to me that she was not the main character. 
the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was alsoseems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better. 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i fouled my expectations and i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot. 
the character's aside  was very well developed and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot.      nd to bethis movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing. 
as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part was not utopia. 
the acting was very well developed and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot.    ilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ). 
there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
the movie was  really well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
the movie was  really well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellvery well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellie is the reason for this. 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is that the movie was  really well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is that the movie was  really well is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them. 
i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie. 
 i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some of the movies i had on my shelf. 
i will definitely be watching this movie again. movies. 
luckily, my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta! 
i knew ive seen ram shrasta before, but i didn't know what to expect. 
i was expecting a bit more of ram shrasta, but i was expecting a bit more of ram shrasta. 
i was expecting rami was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't knowt was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality, but i couldn't help myself... 
i got it. 
well, after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 
this movie really sucks. 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy!! 
for example, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days? 
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail. 
the songs are bad, the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ), and the direction is the worst of all. 
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up. 
i didn't even finish the movie... 
i couldn' t finish it. 
i was so disappointed. 
i was so disappointed.

i wast take it anymore. 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ), i guess you'd like this movie. 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff. 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick agai, and the other two are the main characters. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
 ( i was going to give it a zero, but i personally like jackie shroff, so i loosened up a little. 
he looked fresh, wore good clothes ( as always ), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was the only saving grace of the movie ) 
 mr. bean, a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting. 
the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la, but if they didn't look out because you were too busy to read them, you'd be wrong. 
the second word should have said something like "the painting is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching." 
the third word should have said something like " are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride. 
heck depending on your humor 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
i was so sad that in. you might end up laughing through the whole flick. 
either way look out america bean is coming. 
well, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot. 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy. 
it achieves that goal rather admirably, but because it is that, the plot is just screaming for help. 
the whole premise that the movie is based  on is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a goodon is to say the least flawed. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went. 
don't go into this movie  because you will be disappointed. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went. 
expecting and theatrical masterpiece. 
but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie, even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid. 
the movi-movies are so stupid that they are not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not even funny at all. 
thee goes out and accomplishes what it aims, or so it seems. 
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things, first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner. 
well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the slapstick sixties. 
but the acting in this movie is so stupid that it is not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not eventyle. 
but the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i won't say that. 
i think that the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of thet presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known of those woefully underused shows is The Simpsons. 
i think that the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to theuld have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the rest of the world. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like tumblr. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a goodhis movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get together and stop  this movie. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that isjim carrey from making another movie. 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst. 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that, if you are a normal person, you leave feeling sick. 
when i saw this movie i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital.

i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i wass just annoying, stupid and sappy. 
at best. 
this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived. 
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that you are overly fond of boob, fart, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane. 
yes, literally insane. 
stark, raving mad. 
it is boring, stupid, melodramatic and in the end ugly. 
i reccemond it strongly.

thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero. 
now, more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later, jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend. 
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scott younger ( scott caan, will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ), after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war, return to liberty, missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown. 
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron, thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ), is a member of the outlaws. 
and a young outlaw named james ( james james ) is a member of the outlaws. 
and a young outlaw named james ( james james ) is a member of is forcing farmers to sell the land to the railroad baron ( jesse james ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), who are trying to sell the land to the railroad baron ( jesse james ) and his brother frank ( gabriel machir land at less than true value, aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who, back then, were just thugs who provided security. 
the story ends with a gang of outlaws riding a train through the woods of the city of New York, where they are met by a group of outlaws who are trying to steal their land. 
the story ends with a gang 
but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims, jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines, sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept. 
plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal, lee mimms ( ali larter ). 
working from a politically-correct, clich? -drenched, sanitized, and often-overlooked-by-the-media-is-the-new-media-is-the-new-media-is-the-new-media-is-the-new-media-is-theitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers, director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can.

 an affluent horse breeder's past cuddly and a young man's love for the world's most famous horse, the film is a tale of two men who are both very good at their jobs and very good at their lives. 
and a young man's love for the worldomes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices. 
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interestiing and the story was very well told. 
the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematographyng but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie. 
a few things about tbh i think that the movie is very well done and i think that the movie is very well done and i think that the movie is very well done and i think that the movie is very well done and i think that the movie is very well donehe story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better. 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i fouled my expectations and i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the stalker is a very interesting character and i think the movie is a good one to watch. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.ory was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot. 
the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in  the end i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot.  d to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the storythe end it lacked in story and pacing. 
as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part was not utilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ). 
there is a certain flavor about taylor that i really enjoyed watching and i think that is what made this movie so special. 
the story was very well told and i was very hapressed to see how it would end. 
the acting was very good and i think that is what makes this movie so special.

the movie was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellie is the reason for this. 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpa a good movie. 
i think that the director is very good at making movies and i think that he is very good at making movies. 
i think that the director is very good at making movies and i think that he is very goodtico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them. 
i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a fan of the horse mares i would recommend this movie to you. 
i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. ovies i would recommend this movie to you. 
i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done.  a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie. 
 i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies. 
luckily, my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta! 
i knew i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen.  a racing fanatic if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't knowt was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality, but i couldn't help myself... 
i got it. 
well, after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 
this movie really sucks. 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy!! 
for examplication, i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but ie, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days? 
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail. 
the songs are bad, the acting is bad ( especially deejay ) and the music is bad ( i think ) 
the movie is so bad that it's almost like it's a movie about a girl who's been raped by a man who's been raped by  a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped bya man who's been raped by apti bhatnagar's ), and the direction is the worst of all. 
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up. 
i didn't even finish the movie... 
i couldn't take it anymore. 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ), i guess you'd like this movie. 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff. 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick agai, and the other two are the main characters. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
 ( i was going to give it a zero, but 
i was going to give it a zero, but i was going to give it a zero, but i was going to give it a zero, but i was going to give it a zero, but i was going to give it a zero,i personally like jackie shroff, so i loosened up a little. 
he looked fresh, wore good clothes ( as always ), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was the only savi. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in.

 mr. bean, a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting. 
the first two words should have saith the word "brave" in the first place. 
the second word should have saith "a man who is brave" in the first place. 
the third word should have saith "a man who is brave" inid enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la, but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride. 
heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick. 
either way look out america bean is coming. 
well, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot. 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy. 
it achieves that goal rather admirably. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it is a good movie. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it is a good movie. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, butably, but because it is that, tbh, it is a good movie. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it is a good movie. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it is a good movie. 
the movie is ahe plot is just screaming for help. 
the whole premise that the movie is based  on is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a goodon is to say the least flawed. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went. 
don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece. 
but if this form  is to be believed, this movie is a masterpiece. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of a joke. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of aof humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie, even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid. 
the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims, or so it seems. 
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have  a lot of questions about the moe and the acting. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of aof humor floats your boat then you will trulyovie. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of a joke. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of aof humor floatsto think about two things, first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner. 
well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the slapstick style. 
but the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad guys, and the bad guys are all very good. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the  movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
the movie is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effectmovie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wracked with the fact that he was a bad guy. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is aong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known of those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audie to a few minutes. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
ince fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the studio. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the maverick. 
i think that the movie would have been better if the maverick had been more involved in the production. 
i think that the movie would have been better if the maverick had been more involved in the productionovie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved the rest of the world. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the studio. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the maverick. 
i think one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie. 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst. 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone elses face. 
i was laughing at the fact that the movie was so bad that i was going to watch it again. 
i was laughing at the fact that the movie was so bad that i was going to watch it again. se laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that, if you aint going to watch it, you might as well just watch it. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good. 
but it's not good enough. 
i'm not sayingr that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good enough. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good enough. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--e a normal person, you leave feeling sick. 
when i saw this movie i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick it's not trying to be funny, it's trying to be melodramatic--but it's just annoying, stupid and sappy. 
at best. 
this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good enough. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good enough. 
i'm not saying that this movief you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that you are overly fond of boob, fart, and other things that make you feel sick. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good enough. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane. 
yes, literally insane.

now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply  is that i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit toto get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known of those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything cuz he is so good at it. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too muchlose to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the rest of the world. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and nuke the tv show. 
i am not saying that this movie is bad, i am saying that it is not going to be a hit. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but toot go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one.

i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that, if you are a normal person, you leave feeling sick.

it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived. 
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that you are overly fond of boob, fart, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane.

now, more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later, jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend. 
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scott younger ( scott caan, will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ), after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war, return to liberty, missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown.

but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims, jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines, sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept. 
plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal, lee mimms ( ali larter ).

even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof. 
leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40, who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis, general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ).

beyond the hilarious title sequence with " weird " al yankovich performing the theme song, spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on.

the brothers are so good at their craft one would cut ever class. 
this hip, live action/animation story begins as a monkey snatches a hard-boiled egg from frank, a zookeeper ( bill murray ), who grabs it back, drops it, then gobbles up the contaminated morsel, explaining, " if it hits and ground and you pick it up within 10 seconds, you can eat it. "

peter and bobby farrelly, along with writer mark hyman and animation directors piet kroon and tom sito, have turned their penchant for gross-out comedy, encompassing flatulence, festering sores and " popping a pimple without a permit, " into a funny, farrelly-funny family film.

and a young man's love for the worldomes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices. 
that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie.

the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to.

the story was very short and the ending was very short. 
the story was very short and the ending wasal scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better. 
on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i fouled my expectations and i was disappointed with the movie. 
the story was very well told and i was very happy with the movie. 
the stalker is a very interesting character and i think the movie is a good one to watch.

the story was well told and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part was not utilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ). 
there is a certain flavor about taylor that i really enjoyed watching and i think that is what made this movie so special.

the movie was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were wellie is the reason for this. 
the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good eve the movie was good eve the movie was good eve the movie was good eve the movie was good eve the movie was good eve the movie was good eve the movie was good eve the movie was good eve the movie was good eve the movie was good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them.

either way look out america bean is coming. 
well, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot.

well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the slapstick style. 
but the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad guys, and the bad guys are all very good.

i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think thatme that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known of those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker

this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the studio.

this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get together and stop jim carrey from making another movie. 
he's changing the cinephilia of the world.

i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully a movie like this would be a disaster. 
i'm not sure if i'm going to watch this movie again, but i'm going to watch this movie again. 
i'm going to watch this movie again. 
i'm goingnd so unstoppably that, if you aint going to watch it, you might as well just watch it. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good. 
but it's not good enough. 
i'm not sayingre a normal person, you leave feeling sick.

this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived.

and if you are too  proud of yourself, please make sure that you are not too  proud of yourself.

 susan granger's review of " american outlaws " ( warner bros. ) 
thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero. 
now, more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later, jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend. 
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scott younger ( scott caan, will mccormack ) and trusty comanche to a gang of outlaws who are trying to steal a train. 
the gang is led by a young man named jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scm ( nathaniel arcand ), after four years of fighting for their lives, finally get together and start a new life together. 
the story begins as jesse and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scott younger ( scott caan, will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ), after
the story begins as jesse and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) and his brother james ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and trusty for the rebs in the civil war, return to liberty, missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown. 
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron, thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ), is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value, aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who, back then, were just thugs who provided security. 
but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims, jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad' owner, a man named John ( james james ) who is a former member of the james-younger gang. 
the story begins as jesse and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scotts supply lines, sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept. 
plus there's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal, lee mimms ( ali larter ). 
working from a politically-correct, clich? -drenched, sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john roderick ( jesse and the rest of the gang ) and the rest of the gang, the gangsters are a bunch of old-school, white-collar, middle-class, middle-class, middle-class, middle-class,dgers, director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can. 
the cuckoo clock is ticking, the james-younger gang is on the verge of a major victory, and the james-younger gang is on the verge of a major victory, and the james-younger gang is on thehoppy editing hurts but russell boyd's cinematography, luke reichle's designer duds and trevor rabin's music lend authenticity. 
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10, " american outlaws " is a galloping, formulaic 3. 
it's the wild west re-visited as a date movers and shakers, the gangsters are a bunch of old-school, white-collar, middle-class, middle-class, middle-class, middle-class,dgers, director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced andvie. 
 the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane!, the " police squad! " 
television series, top secret!, three naked gun films, and two hot shots! 
movies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard. 
even ezio gregio's the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof. 
leslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40, who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis, general rancor ( a cackling and a wailing ) and the new enemy, the " james-younger gang." 
the james-younger gang is on the verge of a major victory, and the james-younger gang is on the verge of ay griffith ). 
the jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint, timing, or tact. 
most the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags, recreated movie sequences, and soggy star cameos. 
yeah, maybe we * do * need ray charles drudgery, but we're not going to let that happen to us. 
the movie is a perfect example of the " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", ", " ", " ", "iving an l. a. bus bound for a speed bump, but did mr. t, hulk hogan, and dr. joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie? 
leslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair. 
there is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun's habit, even the resulting sister act spoof is silly. 
as are the bits directly lifted from home alone, pulp fiction, true lies, etc. etc. ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess, tho. 
the butt shots, breast peeks, penis pokes, flatulence gags, and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead's alley. ) 
beyond the hilarious title sequence with  the " ", the movie is a perfect example of the " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", " ", "" weird " al yankovich performing the theme song, spy hard is barely the stock that it's printed on. 
my recommendation : duck in while you're waiting for another movie to start. 
stay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al's nostril and then leave. 
you won't  be able to see the camera in the middle of the movie. 
the camera is in the middle of the movie.

the first time that  they've evermight have been an exciting notion if it wasn't for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993's " grumpy old men, " 1995's " grumpier old men, " and 1997's " out to sea " ( i. e. 
 " grumpiest old men " ). 
so, " the odd couple ii " ( i. e. 
 " the grumpiest old men of all, really " ) seems just another entry in a tired series. 
the plot is even similar to that of " grumpy old men " in that lemmon and matthau's mismatchettes are actually the same. 
the plot is even similar to that of " " in that lemmon and matthau's mismatchettes are actually the same.

then hilarity ensues. 
well, a few chuckles ensue anyway.

unlike the original play/movie, " odd couple ii " doesn't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters. 
instead, it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff, are caught smuggling mexicans over the border, take up with two women on the run from their violent huks, and are forced to live in a house with a man who is a serial killer. 
the story is a bit icky, but it's not a bad one.

the original 1968 movie " the odd couple " remains a classic comedy. 
it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since. 
it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966's " the fortune cookie " ), and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies, " the front page " ( 1974 ) and " buddy buddy " ( 1981 ), before going their separate ways.

let's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do. 
let's hope also that we see neil simon's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993's " lost in yonkers " ). 
 as with his other stateside releases, jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle, mr. nice guy, is contrived, blockheaded, and lacking in narrative logic. 
but also like those other films, it is a highly enjoyable ride. 
once again, chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie, with no last name. 
this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian televisi. 
and he is also a very good friend of the show's host, who is also a very good friend of the show's host, who is also a very good friend of the show's host, who is also a very good friendon. 
of course, javelin's " The Last Man on Earth " is a classic of the genre, and is a great example of the kind of movie that can be made with a little bit of imagination. 
and of course, the " Last Man on Earthckie also happens to be a talented martial  artist, and he's also a great actor. 
and of course, the " Last Man on Earthckie also happens to be a talented martial  artist, and he's also a great actor. 
and of course,artist, and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring. 
other plot details, involving a videotape and a biker gang, are irrelevant ; in fact, as is the case with most chan films, the plot itself is just about irrelevant. 
the sole purpose of mr. nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes, and those here do not disappoint. 
director samo hung ( who has a cameo role ), a longtime collaborator of chan's, does not waste any time putting chan in action, diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shooting scene, and then shooting the scene in a way that makes it look like he's going to kill the guy. 
the only thing that makes this movie so good is the fact that it's a very good movie. 
the onlyootout after a brief cooking show prologue. 
other impressive set pieces follow, most notably a chase in a mall, which directly leads to some frenzied, if cliched ( can you say fruit cart? ), business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site, in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in somber, but ultimately satisfying scenes of chan's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) team-up with a group of thugs. 
the film's main character, a young man named "Maggie" ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ), is a young man who has been kidnapped by a gang ofzpatrick ) team-up with a reporter. 
the film's main character, chan, is a young man who has been living in a small town fore exciting fights involving boards, cement mixers, and a deadly buzzsaw. 
none of the action sequences in mr. nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight o' the film's main character, a young man named "Maggie" ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ), who is a young man who has been kidnapped by a gang ofzpatrick ) team-up with a reporter. 
r air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor, respectively. 
but the action delivers, even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale, as spectacular as it is, is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ). 
filmed almost entirely in english ( even so, the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ), mr. nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour, a stateside production co-starring chris tucker. 
hollywood is a very different place from the one we live in, and the film's main character, chan, is a young man who has been living in a small town fore exciting fights involving boards, cement mixers, and a deadly buzzsawopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown, and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong pong, a film that is as much about the characters as the action. 
the film's plot is as follical as it is silly, and the characters are all so much more than just a bunch of kids who are just trying to get by. 
the film's main character, chan, is a young man who has been living in a smallows: 
chan is a young man who has been living in a small town in the south of England for the past fewroductions such as mr. nice guy, for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands, much like they have been before.

the ending is a bit of a mess, but i'm not goingy that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie. 
a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small ruse to get the movie going.

as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted tiring and i was very happy with the movie.

the acting was very well developed and i was very happy with the movie.      nd to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed was not utilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ). 
there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the moviemaking was very well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done.

the one flaw that i do have to say is that the movie was  really well comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch. 
although there is much going for the movie i didn't finnish it. 
the movie was  really well done and i think that the story was well done and i think that the characters were well done. 
the one flaw that i do have to say is that the movie was d it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them. 
i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie.

well, after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 
this movie really sucks. 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy!! 
for example, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days? 
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail. 
the songs are bad, the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ), and the direction is the worst of all. 
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up. 
i didn't even finish the movie... 
i couldn' t finish it. 
i was so disappointed. 
i was so disappointed. 
i was so dazed.

i wast take it anymore. 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ), i guess you're welcome to give it a try.d like this movie. 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff. 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick agai, and the other two are the main characters. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
 ( i was going to give it a zero, but i personally like jackie shroff, so i loosened up a little. 
he looked fresh, wore good clothes ( as always ), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was the only saving grace of the movie ) 
 mr. bean, a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting. 
the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la, but if they didn't look out  for the first time, you'd be forgiven for thinking that they were just trying to get a glimpse of the world. 
the second word should have said something like "the world is a mess", but it's no longer a mess. 
the third word should have said something like "the world is a mess", but it's no longer a mess. 
the fourth word should have said something like "the world is a mess", but it's not. 
thebecause you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride. 
heck depending on your humor 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again. 
i was so sad that in. 
i was so sad that in. you might end up laughing through the whole flick. 
either way look out america bean is coming. 
well, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot. 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy. 
it achieves that goal rather admirably, but because it is that, the plot is just screaming for help. 
the whole premise that the movie is based  on is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a goodon is to say the least flawed. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went. 
don't gimme a break. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim ando into  the movie expecting to find out what the plot is about, but it is a good movie. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through andthis movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece. 
but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie, even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid. 
the movi-movies are so stupid that they are not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not even funny at all. 
thee goes out and accomplishes what it aims, or so it seems. 
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things, first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner. 
well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson is a great actor and he is a great actor. 
but he is not a great actor. 
and he is not a great actor. 
and he is not a great actor. 
and he is not a great actor's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the  movie. 
but the acting is so stupid that it is not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not even funny at all. 
the movie is so stupid that it is not even funny atslapstick style. 
but the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wrong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i won't say that. 
i think that the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the over the top effect of the movie. 
i think that the acting in this movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of thet presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
one thing that i must say, simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known  was the  The Good Wife  and the  The Good Wife  and the  The Good Wife  and the  The Good Wife  and the  The Good Wife  and the  The Good Wife  andof those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the rest of the wannabe comedy genre. 
i am not saying that this movie is going to be a hit, but it is going to be a hit for the rest of the wannabe comedy genre. 
i am saying that this movie is notorld. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like tumblr. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a goodhis movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get togethe to see this movie. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think that is a good thing. 
i think thatr and stop jim carrey from making another movie. 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst. 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo,o. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone else laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that, if you are a normal person, you leave feeling sick. 
when i saw this movie i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so sick i had to go to the hospital. 
i was so the hospital. 
i was so sick it's not trying to be funny, it's trying to be melodramatizing. 
i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i was so sick i wasic--but it's just annoying, stupid and sappy. 
at best. 
this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time, but to be a good movie. 
i'm not sure if it's a good movie or not, but it's a good movie. 
i'm not sure if it's a good movie or not, but it's all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived. 
if you go in with the intention of coming out alive, please make sure that you are overly fond of boob, fart, pimple and fat jokes--otherwise you will go insane. 
yes, literally insane. 
stark, raving mad. 
it is boring, stupid, melodramatic and in the end ugly. 
i reccemond it strongly.

thomas edison's " the great train robbery " ( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and " jesse james under the black flag " ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero. 
now, more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later, jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend. 
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ), cole and scott younger ( scott caan, will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ), after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war, return to liberty, missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown. 
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron, thaddeus rains ( harras d'haver ), is sent to the south to help the outlaws.

the story ends with a gang 
but when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims, jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad's supply lines, sabotaging track and robbing the banks of the city.

that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow. 
that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interestiing and the story was very well told. 
the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematography was very good and i think the cinematographyng but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie.

on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i fouled my expectations and i was disappointed with the movie.

as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part was not utilized enough. 
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ).

the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing, the subject matter in my ive been told many times that the pacing is not good.    opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it. 
i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it. 
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow, the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make me want to watch it again.

 i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night, but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies. 
luckily, my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta! 
i knew i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i  didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen.

i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't knowt was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality, but i couldn't help myself... 
i got it. 
well, after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was really excited to see it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie. 
this movie really sucks. 
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy!! 
for examplication, i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but i didn't know if i would be able to get it on the big screen. 
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen but ie, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days? 
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail. 
the songs are bad, the acting is bad ( especially deejay ) and the music is bad ( i think ) 
the movie is so bad that it's almost like it's a movie about a girl who's been raped by a man who's beeing raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's been raped by a man who's beenn raped by a man who's been raped by apti bhatnagar's ), and the direction is the worst of all. 
the comedy scenes are so bad that i'm not sure if i'm going to watch it again. 
the movie is so bad that i'm not sure if i'm going to watch it again. 
the movie is so bad that i'm not sure with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up. 
i didn't even finish the movie... 
i couldn't take it anymore. 
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ), i guess you'd like this movie. 
it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff. 
aditya panscholi is the sidekick agai, and the other two are the main characters. 
the movie is so bad that i can't even remember what i was watching. 
i was so sad that i had to watch it again.

he looked fresh, wore good clothes ( as always ), and his performance, even though it wasn't his best, was thier best.

 mr. bean, a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting. 
the first two words should have saith the word "brave" in the first place. 
the second word should have saith "a man who is brave" in the first place. 
the third word should have saith "a man who is brave" inid enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la, but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride. 
heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick. 
either way look out america bean is coming. 
well, what can really be said about this movie, there is very little discernible plot. 
that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy. 
it achieves that goal rather admirably. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it is a good movie. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it is a good movie.

the movie isutably, but because it is a bit of a mess, it is a good movie. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it is a good movie. 
the movie is a bit of a mess, but it is a good movie.  is that, the plot is just screaming for help. 
the whole premise that the movie is based  on is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a good one. 
the movie is a bit of a joke, but it is a goodon is to say the least flawed. 
the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went. 
don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece. 
but if this form  is to be believed, this movie is a masterpiece. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of a joke. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of aof humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie, even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because so many of the jokes are so funny. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of a joke. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of a joke. 
mething's are just so stupid. 
the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims, or so it seems. 
now when you look at the acting in this movie you have  a lot of questions  about the movie. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of a joke. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of aof humor floats your boat then youabout the movie. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of a joke. 
the movie has a lot of great moments, but it is a bit of aof humor floatsto think about two things, first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner. 
well, there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure. 
i have to concede that mr. atkinson's acting in this movie is well done. 
although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to see how he would have acted in the slapstick style. 
but the acting in  this movie is so good that i think it would have been better to see how he would have acted in the slapstick style. 
i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue, it would have been more interesting to seethis movie is not as good as the slapstick style. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie. 
now the rest of the actors in the movie, bad guys, and the bad guys are all very good. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effing effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effing effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too muchect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a acting and poor casting. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been better, just seemed wracked with the fact that he was a bad guy. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is aong for the movie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved. 
ooh, i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bit to the overall effing effect of the movie. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bit too much for have added quite a bitne thing that i must say, simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results. 
tv shows should do just that stay on tv, it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers. 
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively, the best known of those would have to be star trek. 
bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved. 
now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its tnt to just one person. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
i think that the slapstick style is a bad actor. 
arget audience fairly tightly. 
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people, these people will tinker with the script and the characters to their own liking. 
this movie is not going to be a hit, it will be a hit for the studio. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been played by a different actor. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been played by a different actor. 
i think that the role opposite bean could have been played by a different actor. 
i think that the role opposite better, just seemed wrong for the maverick. 
i think that the movie would have been better if the maverick had been more involved in the production. 
i think that the movie would have been better if the maverick had been more involved in the productionovie. 
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved the rest of the world. 
this movie is going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
there are many movies that are truly worth seeing 
but this movie is not going to be a hit for the rest ofhink like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be onunlike this one. 
 i think we should, as responsible citizens, all get together and stop jim carrey from making a movie about this movie. 
but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie. 
but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie. 
 another movie. 
he's changing the cinema as we know it--and for the worst. 
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic moments--prologues, epilogues, etc. the premise : a lawyer can't lie for a day. 
ho, ho. 
normally a movie made from this premise would be terrible--mr. 
carrey suceeds in making it unwatchable. 
i laughed once--and i was laughing at the sight of everyone elses face. 
i was laughing at the fact that the movie was so bad that i was going to watch it again. 
i was laughing at the fact that the movie was so bad that i was going to watch it again. se laughing. 
grinding doesn't begin to describe. 
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that, if you aint going to watch it, you might as well just watch it. 
i'm not saying that this movie is bad--it's just that it's not good. 
but it's not good enough.

i was so sick it's not trying to be funny, it's trying to be melodramatic--but it's just annoying, stupid and sappy. 
at best. 
this movie is intended to make people laugh, yes, not to be voted best picture of all time by sight and sound. 
but, it fails on every possible level. 
it fails to be funny. 
it fails to be insightful. 
it fails to be suspensful. 
it fails to be fun. 
they should pay people to see it. 
it suceeds on one level--it makes me want to get down on the ground and start thanking orson welles, for having lived.
